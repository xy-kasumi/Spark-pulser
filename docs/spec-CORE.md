# CORE (r0) PCB Spec / Cheatsheet for Firmware Developer

This document specifies the PCB hardware interface needed for firmware development,
to meet the requirements defined in [user-CORE.md](user-CORE.md).


## Conditions to consider

* Some STPDRV boards are unavailable
* PULSER board is unavailable

Firmware must map these states to well-defined safe behaviors.

## uC Overview

The uC is a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board.
* [Pico 2 board datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/pico-2-datasheet.pdf)
* [RP2350 chip datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf)

uC operating environment
* 5V 1A powered, regulated down from 12V main power
* System clock: 150 MHz
* Firmware write via 3-pin QI connector SWD interface

STPDRV r0, PULSER r1 is assumed.
PULSER r0 pin notes are left for historical reference.


## STPDRV boards

The STPDRV board is a 14-pin child board, taking 3.3V logic power and 12V power input.

Each STPDRV board has:
* A single TMC2130 stepper driver motor
* On-PCB configuration jumpers for:
  * Phase current (0.2A vs 0.4A)
  * Power voltage (5V vs 12V)

They're controlled by SPI & "STEP/DIR" interface.
SPI bus connects uC and 3 STPDRV boards.

To address each chip individually, CSN pins are used.
CSNs are GPIO pins, so firmware needs to manually toggle them when doing SPI transactions.

# PULSER board

Nothing is done in PULSER. Just a direct connection.
See [user-PULSER.md](user-PULSER.md) for details.
