# Pulser Board

ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

Open-source EDM board.

Created for https://github.com/xy-kasumi/Spark project,
but probably will work for other EDM topology (wire, die-sinker) too.

### Build & Use
* docs: manuals for using or building the board
* firmware: Pico2 based firmware
* pcb: JLCPCB friendly KiCad files

These are necessary for building, testing, and using the machine.
